           <p>Position: Midfielder
Matches played: 159 official matches
Goals: 20
English International: 115 matches

               The English midfielder was always a key member of the dressing room at all of his clubs He not only had a fantastic touch which made him one of the best players in dead ball situations,
               but he also had a capacity for working hard and making sacrifices  which is not often found in star players.
               After his successful stint at Manchester United, he arrived at Real Madrid where the expectation generated by his signing was enormous.
               The Whites had bought one of the most famous media personalities in the history of football.
               Beckham won over the Bernabéu fans very quickly and within a few weeks he had already won his first title with the club, the Spanish Super Cup.
               The precision of his passing and his elegance when striking the ball earned him the devotion of the fans who were also grateful for the way he identified with the club.
               His major achievement as a Madrid player came in his last season which saw an exciting contest for the 2007 Liga, in which the Englishman played a key role in winning the title.
               Beckham left a fine impression when he left the club having scored 20 goals in 158 matches.
               He was also captain of England and played 115 matches for his national team, making him the second most capped English player after Peter Shilton. He played in three World Cups (1998, 2002 and 2006) and two European Championships (2000 and 2004)..

          <p>1991–1994: Youth and early-career
Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[43] Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.[43]

Manchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United.
              The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.[44]

         <h3 style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">LA Galaxy</h3>
            <p>Beckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side LA Galaxy. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.[106]

The announcement made global headlines and elevated the league's profile.
                Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250 million,[107] the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).
                [108] To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay, also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5 million in total or $6.5 million per year.
